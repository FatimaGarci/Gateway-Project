          <p><strong>Guatemala</strong>, country of <em>Central America.</em> The dominance of an Indian culture within its interior uplands distinguishes Guatemala from its Central American neighbours. The origin of the name Guatemala is <em>Indian,</em> but its derivation and meaning are undetermined. Some hold that the original form was Quauhtemallan (indicating an Aztec rather than a <em>Maya</em> origin), meaning “land of trees,” and others hold that it is derived from Guhatezmalha, meaning “mountain of vomiting water”— referring no doubt to such volcanic eruptions as the one that destroyed Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (modern-day <em>Antigua Guatemala</em> ), the first permanent Spanish capital of the region’s captaincy general. The country’s contemporary capital, <em>Guatemala City</em> , is a major metropolitan centre; <em>Quetzaltenango</em> in the western highlands is the nucleus of the Indian population.<br>
            A slow political and economic recovery continued into the early 21st century. Elections have been held regularly since 1996, but, because there are many political parties, which tend to be small and short-lived, convergence on political solutions has been rare. Fear of a military return to power has preoccupied voters in the first years of the 21st century.<br>
            Approximately 40 percent of the population of Guatemala is urban. The most populated area is the country's capital, Guatemala City, which boasts a metropolitan population of over two million people. Guatemala is a leader in Central American's commerce and manufacturing. It produces and exports petroleum, minerals, tobacco, electrical goods, pharmaceuticals, food, and textiles. Tourism in Guatemala also thrives, particularly in Antigua, which is a major cultural center of Guatemala City. Agriculture represents about 25 percent of the Guatemala's income, and farming accounts for nearly half of the nation's workforce. Approximately 36 percent of the country's exports go to the United States, which in turn comprises about 40 percent of Guatemala's imports. Guatemala also exports to other Central American countries, as well as to Japan and Germany.

            <br><h3>   El Quetzal </h3>
            <p>First of all, the <strong>quetzal</strong> was incredibly <strong>important to the indigenous Maya of the country.</strong> The bird represents liberty, and is said to die of sadness if it is caged. For this reason the Mayans would pluck a few of its highly prized feathers before setting it free.</p>

          <h3 class="heading_title">Traditional Foods</h3>
          <p class="traditional_paragraph">Most people who have travelled through Central America will argue that Guatemala has the most delicious food. With its Maya culture merging with Spanish traditions, the local cuisine here is far more flavoursome and complex than that of the neighbouring countries. Tourist hot spots, such as Antigua, certainly aren’t short of excellent restaurants and international food, but if you’re looking for something more authentic, we’ve got you covered. Here are 10 of the most traditional dishes from Guatemala.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><h3>Chicken pepián</h3>
              <p>Guatemala doesn’t really have a national dish, but pepián is probably the closest thing to it. This spicy stew, borne out of the fusion of the Spanish and Maya cultures, is one of the oldest dishes in Guatemala. Although chicken is most commonly used, it can also be made with beef or pork. All varieties of the dish contain both fruit and vegetables (usually pear, squash, carrot, potato and corn) and a rich mix of spices. It’s traditionally served with rice and tortillas.</p>
            </li>
            <li><h3>Rellenitos</h3>
              <p>For those with a sweet tooth, make sure you try some rellenitos. Essentially Guatemalan donuts, rellenitos are made up of cooked plantains mashed with refried bean paste, sugar and cinnamon, and then they are deep-fried. When mixed with sugar, both the beans’ taste and texture are similar to chocolate, and the consistency of the rellenitos is incredibly moreish.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Tamales</h3>
              <p>Christmas in Guatemala, focus on: TAMALES! Guatemalan tamales are quite different from the Mexican tamales you may be more familiar with. These tamales are wrapped in banana leaves for one thing, which imparts a grassy floral scent, and they are two or three times larger than tamales made in corn husks.</p>
