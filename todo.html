        anywhere else. Things like smoking volcanoes, world-famous coffee fresh
        from the slopes where it’s grown and roasted, and ruins of the
        once-great Mayan civilization.Guatemala is a place to mingle with the
        locals, including roaming the country in a colorfully painted former
        school bus, called a chicken bus. Oh, the country has some great beaches
        and stunningly blue lakes.

            to become a Maya superpower, a status it also enjoyed in the 7th
            century CE when some of the site's most impressive later monuments
